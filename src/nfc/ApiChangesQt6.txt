This document lists the API changed done to QtNFC between Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.

- Removed function QNearFieldTarget::url(). No replacement available as the function was never implemented.
- Removed function QNearFieldTarget::sendCommands(...). No replacement available as the function needs to be implemented by the API user.
- Renamed function QNearFieldManager::isAvailable() to QNearFieldManager::isEnabled().
- Removed functions QNearFieldTarget::keepConnection() and QNearFieldTarget::setKeepConnection(...). Keeping the connection is the default behavior now.
- Removed QML API. No replacement available because the support has been discontinued.
