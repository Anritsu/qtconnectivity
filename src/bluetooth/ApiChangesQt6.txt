This document lists the API changes done between Qt Bluetooth 5.15 and the first
QtBluetooth release in the Qt 6 series. This file is temporary in nature to keep track of API
changes for further documentation later on.

QBluetoothDeviceInfo
--------------------

- QBluetoothDeviceInfo::manufacturerData() returns a QMultiHash rather than QHash. Since Qt 6
QMultiHash no longer derives from QHash.
