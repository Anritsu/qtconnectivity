This document lists the API changes done between Qt Bluetooth 5.15 and the first
QtBluetooth release in the Qt 6 series. This file is temporary in nature to keep track of API
changes for further documentation later on.

QBluetoothDeviceInfo
--------------------

- manufacturerData() returns a QMultiHash rather than QHash. Since Qt 6
  QMultiHash no longer derives from QHash.

- DataCompleteness was removed without replacement.

- setServiceUuids(const QList<QBluetoothUuid>, DataCompleteness) was replaced by
  setServiceUuids(const QVector<QBluetoothUuid> &uuids)

- DataCompleteness serviceUuidsCompleteness() const was removed without replacement.

- QList<QBluetoothUuid> serviceUuids(DataCompleteness *completeness = nullptr) const was replaced by
  QVector<QBluetoothUuid> serviceUuids() const.
